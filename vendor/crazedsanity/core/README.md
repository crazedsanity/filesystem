# Core Libraries for All Things Crazed(Sanity).

These are the core PHP libraries for all things Crazed(Sanity).  Pretty much every other (new) library from CrazedSanity depends on these libaries.

These libraries have been extracted from crazedsanity/cs-content.  The intention is to normalize the names, add some namespaces, and hopefully make development a bit easier.

Includes: 
 * Version (for parsing version strings)
 * ToolBox (for string manipulation, debugging, etc)
 * AutoLoader
 * LockFile (to avoid process-tripping, etc)
